Welcome to [Matcha::connect](http://www.matchaconnect.com/)
=====================

[Matcha::Connect](http://www.matchaconnect.com/) is a Open source microORM for Sencha in PHP:
Matcha::connect microORM v0.0.1
This set of classes will help Sencha ExtJS and PHP developers deliver fast and powerful application fast and easy to develop.
If Sencha ExtJS is a GUI Framework of the future, think Matcha micrORM as the bridge between the Client-Server
GAP. 

Matcha will read and parse a Sencha Model .js file and then connect to the database and produce a compatible database-table
from your model. Also will provide the basic functions for the CRUD. If you are familiar with Sencha ExtJS, and know 
about Sencha Models, you will need this PHP Class. You can use it in any way you want, in MVC like pattern, your own pattern, 
or just playing simple. It's compatible with all your coding stile. 
 
Taking some ideas from diferent microORM's and full featured ORM's we bring you this super Class. 

History:
Born in the fields of GaiaEHR we needed a way to develop the application more faster, Gino Rivera suggested the use of an
microORM for fast development, and the development began. We tried to use some already developed and well known ORM on the 
space of PHP, but none satisfied our purposes. So Gino Rivera sugested the development of our own microORM (a long way to run).

But despite the long run, it returned to be more logical to get ideas from the well known ORM's and how Sensha manage their models
so this is the result.
