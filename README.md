=====================

Matcha::connect microORM v0.0.1
[Matcha::Connect](http://www.matchaconnect.com/) is a Open source microORM for Sencha in PHP:
This a set of classes that will help Sencha ExtJS and PHP developers deliver fast and powerful 
applications. If Sencha ExtJS is a webGUI Framework of the future, think Matcha micrORM as the 
bridge between the Client-Server GAP of the future. 

Matcha will read and parse a Sencha Model .js file and then connect to the database and produce 
a compatible database-table from your model. Also will provide the basic functions for the CRUD. 
If you are familiar with Sencha ExtJS, and know about Sencha Models, you will need this PHP Class. 
Developers can use it in any way you want, in MVC like pattern, your own pattern, or just playing 
simple. It's compatible with all your coding style.  

History:
Taking some ideas from diferent microORM's and full featured ORM's we bring you this cool Class.
Born in the fields of GaiaEHR we needed a way to develop the application more faster, 
Gino Rivera suggested the use of an microORM for fast development and the development began. 
We tried to use some already developed and well known ORM's on the space of PHP, but none satisfied 
our needs. So Gino Rivera sugested the development of our own microORM for GaiaEHR (a long way to run).

But despite the long run, it returned to be more logical to get ideas from the well known ORM's 
and how Sensha manage their models and create a microORM for GaiaEHR, so this is the result.

Some ideas where from RedBeanPHP and Propel.
